# SelfReflector

is an internet connected mirror that uses the API Face++ (http://www.faceplusplus.com/api-overview/) to guess your age and play music from when it thinks you were 14. 

this version plays music from a bespoke list that we can't share (sorrY) - but you can make your own (pick 4 tracks from any year from 2014 back to 1930 and list as year(a, b, c, or d).mp3 = e.g. 1985a.mp3 . 

working on a spotify version... coming soon
